# ATPG_for_FIFO
ATPG insertion for 8 bit FIFO using Cadence Modus
steps:
1. Keep the design file ready.
2. Use the tcl script to automate the Cadence Genus and Cadence Modus commands.
3. Get results of the Fault Coverage.
4. Perform Fault simulation by applying the generated ATPG patterns and obtain the final set of results and the simulation waveform.

Note:
Muxed flip-flop is being used as the scan cell.
